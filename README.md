# Ad_ClickPrediction
Ad Click Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts whether a user will click on an advertisement based on user and ad-related features using a Machine Learning model. The model learns patterns from historical data to understand user behavior and make accurate click predictions.

The project uses a supervised learning algorithm and the trained model is saved as a pickle (.pkl) file. A simple Streamlit web application is created to take user inputs and display the prediction, demonstrating the complete machine learning workflow from model training to deployment.
